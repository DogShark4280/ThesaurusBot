# Thesaurize Bot
A bot for Discord that makes sentences make 70% less sense. Heavily inspired
by OrionSuperman's [Reddit bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThesaurizeThis/). 
By replacing each word in a sentence with a random synonym you can produce some
pretty hilarious results.

This bot is still under development and, as such, is not ready for primetime.
You can run the bot and it does actually work, but some optimizations and new
features still need to be added before it's _actually_ done.
